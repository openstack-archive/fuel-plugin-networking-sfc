Networking sfc plugin
=============================

Fuel Networking SFC plugin extends Mirantis OpenStack functionality by
installing networking sfc support.

Problem description
===================

Currently, Fuel has no support for  Networking SFC. Networking sfc plugin aims
to provide support for it.

Proposed change
===============

Implement a Fuel plugin that will install Networking SFC support.

Performance Impact
------------------

Networking SFC plugin has no direct performance impact on OpenStack, but it
consumes additional resources (CPU, memory, database) and this should be
considered and tested on a test environment before production use.

Other deployer impact

Implementation
==============

Plugin delivers Networking SFC support for Fuel. Plugin has several tasks:

* The first task changes package fuel-ha-utils which comes from base Fuel 9.0
  to package with applied fix https://review.openstack.org/#/c/334415.
  It's needed for proper Networking SFC deployment with Fuel 9.0.
* The second task concerns controllers. Installs networking-sfc package on
  controllers and configures Fuel to use it.
* The third task concerns computes nodes. Installs networking-sfc package on
  computes and configures Fuel to use it.

Networking SFC is installed on all environments which have plugin enabled.
Plugin configures all needed Openstack services.
