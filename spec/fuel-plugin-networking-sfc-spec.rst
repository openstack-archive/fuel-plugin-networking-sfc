Implementation
==============

Plugin delivers networking sfc support to Fuel. Plugin has several tasks:

* The first task change package fuel-ha-utils which comes from base Fuel 9.0
  for package with applied fix https://review.openstack.org/#/c/334415.
  It's needed for proper working networking sfc on Fuel 9.0.
* The second task concerns controllers. It install networking-sfc package and
  configure Fuel for using networking sfc.
* The third task concerns computes nodes. It install networking-sfc package
  and configure Fuel for using networking sfc.

Networking sfc is installed on all environments which has enabled plugin.
Plugin configures all needed Openstack services.
